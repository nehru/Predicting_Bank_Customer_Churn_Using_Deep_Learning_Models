# Predicting_Bank_Customer_Churn_Using_Deep_Learning_Models
As a Data Scientist for the bank, your goal is to build a neural network-based classifier that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) within the next 6 months. By leveraging deep learning, this model will help the bank identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

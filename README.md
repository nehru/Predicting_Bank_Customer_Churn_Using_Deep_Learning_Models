**Bank Churn Prediction Using Neural Networks**

Businesses like banks, which provide essential services, face the challenge of Customer Churnâ€”the phenomenon where customers leave for other service providers. It is crucial for banks to understand the factors that drive this behavior, as this insight can help management focus on improving the service in ways that matter most to their customers.

Objective

As a Data Scientist for the bank, your goal is to build a neural network-based classifier that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) within the next 6 months. By leveraging **deep learning**, this model will help the bank identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

Key Features

**Use of deep learning techniques for churn prediction**.

Neural network architecture designed to identify important service-related factors affecting customer decisions.
Predictive model that enables the bank to take data-driven actions to minimize customer churn.
This project showcases the power of neural networks in solving real-world business problems related to customer retention.

This description emphasizes the use of deep learning and neural networks while keeping the focus on solving the business problem of customer churn prediction.
